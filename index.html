      <h4><a href="projects/img-server/index.html">Simple Image Server</a></h4>
      <p><em>React JS, Bootstrap, Flexbox CSS, Sass</em></p>
      <p>A landing page and dashboard for an image server product. Click the Log in/Log out button at the top right to switch between pages.  This was my first time using both Bootstrap and Flexbox, and I found myself little by little eliminating the Bootstrap styles and column system and replacing them with Flexbox CSS.  I first coded the dashboard as a static page, then converted it to a React app in order to add functionality to the form and the visibility toggles.</p>

      <h4><a href="projects/tictactoe/index.html">Tic Tac Toe</a></h4>
      <p><em>Hand-coded JavaScript, simple HTML/CSS</em></p>
      <p>A player vs. computer version of the game.  The biggest challenge here was creating the AI.  At first, I coded it to simply choose any open space, but I went back and improved upon it so that it will recognize and take a winning move when available, and block the user from a winning move, as well.</p>

      <h4><a href="projects/google-homepage/index.html">Google Homepage</a></h4>
      <p><em>HTML/CSS</em></p>
      <p>Because my focus has been largely on JavaScript, I wanted an exercise in simple HTML/CSS as a way to refresh and apply my layout skills.  This is a static, non-functional version of the Google homepage.</p>
