      <h4>Simple Image Server</h4>
      <p>Technology Used: React JS, Bootstrap, Flexbox CSS</p>
      <p>Description: This project is a landing page and dashboard for an image server product.  This was my first time using both Bootstrap and Flexbox, and I found myself little by little eliminating the Bootstrap styles and column system and replacing them with Flexbox CSS.  The two technologies are not compatible when it comes to creating a responsive layout - Bootstrap's columns won't respond correctly if you have flex styles applied - so while it is interesting to try each out, I have been having fun moving everything over to Flexbox.</p>

      <h4>Tic Tac Toe - Player vs. Computer</h4>
      <p>Technology Used: Hand-coded JavaScript, simple HTML/CSS</p>
      <p>Description: This project was a way to try out my JavaScript skills in a practical and fun way.  The biggest challenge was creating the AI and making it somewhat smart.  At first, I coded it to simply choose any open space, but I went back and improved upon it so that it will recognize and take a winning move when available, and block the user from a winning move, as well.  Though it largely works, there is some bugginess that has given me an opportunity now to learn to write tests to find the issues - still a WIP.</p>

      <h4>Google Homepage</h4>
      <p>Technology Used: HTML/CSS</p>
      <p>Description: Because my focus has been largely on JavaScript, I wanted an exercise in simple HTML/CSS as a way to refresh and apply my layout skills.  This is a static, non-functional version of the Google homepage.</p>
