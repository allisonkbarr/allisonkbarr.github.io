Since February 1 of this year, I have been working remotely for Quartet, a startup in NYC. This is now my 3rd time working remotely as part of a non-remote team, the first two as a PM and now as an engineer. There are plenty of resources out there for finding tools and tips for working remotely, but how well you handle the transition is largely down to the emotional and mental experience of it.

And so, here is a pep-talk of sorts for those going remote.

So you've been given the go ahead to work remotely in an entirely non-remote team. Good for you! This means you put yourself out there and advocated for yourself. You bet on your worth to your company and that bet paid off. Congrats!

If you haven't worked remotely before - or even if you have - there is one thing that was passed on to me by another remote engineer that you may find helpful:

You will question yourself and your work sometimes.

At times, you will feel like you aren't living up to your team's expectations. You will have days, even weeks, where you don't feel as productive as you want. You will wonder if you are being helpful enough, responsive enough; if you are contributing enough.

If you don't have a manager who is already giving you good feedback, find someone who will so that any one of these worries doesn't have to last too long. Know that there are people who want you to succeed. If you treat working remotely both as a skill you can develop and a partnership that requires accommodation on both sides, you can lift some of this burden off your shoulders.

That said, there are also people around you who are doubters. Some people, in trying to understand your experience, will impose their own negative perceptions. There will also be plenty of people with their own visions of what remote work <em>should</em> look like. Be open and welcoming of advice, but know that only you and your team can work out what is best for you.

Stand tall for yourself. You got this.
