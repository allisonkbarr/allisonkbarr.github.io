I've begun this blog to record my experience as I attempt a career and lifestyle pivot -- from a resident of Santa Monica, CA, working as an producer at an interactive agency, to a self-employed/freelance web developer living the digital nomad life.

At the end of June, we'll be leaving all this behind as we drive cross-country, spend a few months with family in New England, and then take off for a year (plus or minus) of travel.

I'll be using the blog to share some code snippets as I learn, to talk about the learning process, and to share my experience as I attempt to make this work/life pivot succeed.
