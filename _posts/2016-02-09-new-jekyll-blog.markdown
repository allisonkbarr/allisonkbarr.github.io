I finally got around to moving my dev blog from Wordpress over to Github Pages, setting myself up to work with Jekyll. Hurray!

I feel proud of my progress in the past few months, not just in skill, but in attitude, as well, and I feel like this is one tangible example of my improved confidence. A few months ago, I looked briefly at the process for setting myself up with Jekyll on Github Pages, and I was intimidated by it and so pushed it off. But yesterday, I was ready to dig in to the documentation and make it happen.

I'm working on another post about a site I recently rebuilt from scratch using Deku and Redux, so I'll keep this post short. I do want to note, though, that although I've been rather bad about writing in this blog, you can read all about my travel experiences on my other blog - [Tumbleweeding](http://www.tumbleweeding.com). I am in Croatia through the end of the month, then on to Spain!
