In May 2015, I left my job as an interactive producer to focus on learning to code, and while I was at it, to travel the world! You'll find me at Airbnbs and cafes across Europe, MacBook open and Americano near at hand.

My focus is on clean, functional javascript and elegantly responsive site builds.

I am currently available for freelance, remote gigs. [Get in touch!](mailto:allisonkeane@gmail.com)
