I began my coding journey in May 2015 when I quit my job as an interactive producer to focus on learning to code - and to travel around Europe for a year while I was at it. Since then, I moved through the IC levels and on into management. You can learn more about my career path and current state on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allisonkeane/).
