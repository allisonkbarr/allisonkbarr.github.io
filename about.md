I began my coding journey in May 2015 when I quit my job as an interactive producer to focus on learning to code - and to travel around Europe for a year while I was at it. Since then, I've joined the team at [Quartet](https://www.quartethealth.com/), a mental health startup, as a full-time, full-stack engineer. We use React and Node (Express, Koa), and lately TypeScript, to build apps that we hope will change lives.

My favorite kind of code is clean and functional, and though I focus on javascript at work, I've been known to play around with Elm, Clojure, and even Haskell.

I am currently available for freelance, remote gigs. [Get in touch!](mailto:allisonkeane@gmail.com)
